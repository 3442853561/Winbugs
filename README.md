# Winbugs
I need help developing this project.
- Write documents
- Fix bugs and potential problems
- Some constructive comments
- Borrow me some time

This is an open source control library.
I try to do it more simple. Ideally,
simpler than simple.
As an Asians, my English isn't very authentic.
So what I need most is some internationalized English expression.
